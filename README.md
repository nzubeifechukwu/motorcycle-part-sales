# Analyzing Motorcycle Part Sales

In this project, I analyze the sales data of a company that deals in motorcycle parts. Specifically, I calculate the net revenue for each product line, grouping results by the month when and the warehouse where the sale happened.

For a step-by-step analysis, please see the `motorcycle_part_sales.ipynb` notebook.
